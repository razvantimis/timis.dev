  It's a medical app used for diagnosing heart diseases.
  It has two main components: one for diagnosing a heart disease using artificial neural networks and one for monitoring the heart beats using a fitness bracelet. As a bracelet I've used the Xiaomi Band 2. The aim of the app is to combine these two components.
   In the case of increasing heart beats for a patient with a high risk of a heart disease (as predicted by the ANN), an alert (e-mail or SMS) will be sent to the patient or to his contact person.
